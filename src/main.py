# I need to first split the images, DEM and RGB. Therefore each DEM will have a dedicated RGB 
# Then we need to loop through each RGB image and predict the segmentation for each RGB cut image, and save somewere easy to retrieve
# then, for each RGB image, we need to make a csv binary mask file with appropiate names.
# then, for each dem image, we will need to loop through each dem&predicted labels and glue and compute a vertical displacement 
# Then we need to overlay the image and save it wwhile looping through each predicted dem
# then we need to glue visualization image together


# Notes, as of now, resized dems are stored in the original folder while resized RGB have their own folder. Consider moving everything to parent folder
